BioVec
--------------------------------------

A new approaches for representing biological sequences.

### Models

##### 1. [ProtVec Model](docs/protvec.md)
> [ProtVec: A Continuous Distributed Representation of Biological Sequences](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.05140v1.pdf)
> We propose a new approach for representing biological sequences. This method, named protein-vectors or ProtVec for short, can be utilized in bioinformatics applications such as family classification, protein visualization, structure prediction, disordered protein identification, and protein-protein interaction prediction. Using the Skip-gram neural networks, protein sequences are represented with a single dense n-dimensional vector.

### Installation
```
pip install biovec
